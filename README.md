## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS library
- [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) - JS library

### Continued development

I would like to explore more JS libraries out there like React to use on future projects that can help achieve greater and expected results on the web with less effort, just like Bootstrap in CSS which saves so much time and effort in making a responsive webpage.
